# Bool's Realm 
A fully analogue eurorack logic module

## what is it
It's a logic module 

## what are the things
There's a rough schematic that can be imported to Circuit JS. I hope to
eventually make a more "REAL" schematic.

The Arduino folder contains a simple square wave generator app that can
effectively be used as mock inputs.

### TODO
- front panel design
- schematics that are actually useful and readable
- maybe fix 2-input XOR behavior someday
